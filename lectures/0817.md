All of the labs that come before the project phase (which starts a week from tomorrow) are now available.

Labs 6, 7, and 8 each introduce one of the three project areas:
* Lab 6: Games in Python using PyGame (Curt's area)
* Lab 7: Machine Learning in Python (Niema's area)
* Lab 8: Web apps in Python using Flask (Phill's area)

# Webapps in Python

We are using Flask

Another alternative is Django, but Flask is generally easier to learn.

Modern web apps often separate the back end (code that runs on the server) from the front end (code that runs on the browser).

Code that runs in the browser typically has to be written in JavaScript.. no other choice.

To keep things simple, we will only focus on server side code written in Python.
